# Data Projects

As well as demonstrating a technical skills, a key goal of each of these projects was to solve real work problems. 

Each project contains a link to the full analysis, and where relevant, code.

## HESA KFI Analysis

**Skills used:** working with stakeholders to understand a business problem; Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib); cleaning data; finding and handling outliers; data visualisation; presenting results to stakeholders.

This project takes open data from HESA, the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency.

I was asked to review whether there is a significant correlation between two of the Key Financial Indicators collected by HESA:
* Surplus/(deficit) as a % of total income
* Net cash inflow from operating activities as a % of total income

One of my employer's projects was to improve cash forecasting, and the Financial Planning Team requested that I look into whether surplus/deficit % was correlated with net cash inflow, and whether the budgeted surplus/deficit % could be used to forecast net cash inflow. (NB: In a for-profit company, the surplus/deficit would be the profit/loss).

I downloaded ten years of data on Key Financial Indicators for UK Higher Education Institutions and cleaned, transformed, investigated and visualised the data, and presented my conclusions.
