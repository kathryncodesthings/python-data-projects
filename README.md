# python-data-projects

This project takes open data from HESA, the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency.

I was asked to review whether there is a significant correlation between two of the KFIs collected by HESA:
* Surplus/(deficit) as a % of total income
* Net cash inflow from operating activities as a % of total income
